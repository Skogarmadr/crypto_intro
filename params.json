It is aimed\r\nat introducing basic cryptography topics to programmers who are \r\nunfamiliar with cryptography. It uses the \r\n[PyCrypto](https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/)\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\nIt includes a library of sample code to illustrate use of the PyCrypto\r\nlibrary as well as a tutorial. The sample code is purposefully simple to\r\nillustrate clearly how to use the software.\r\n\r\nIncluded source files (in src/):\r\n\r\n\tsecretkey.py\tsecret key cryptographic functions\r\n\tpublickey.py\tpublic key cryptographic functions\r\n\r\nContributors:     \r\n* [zenmower](https://github.com/clarke187) provided grammar, spelling, and \r\nreadability critiques.   \r\n* [Kim Lidstr√∂m](https://github.com/dxtr) provided spelling critiques.\r\n* [Erik Musick](http://erikmusick.com/) provided grammar and spelling critiques.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
