Introduction to Cryptography with PyCrypto
==========================================

author: kyle isom <coder@kyleisom.net>

This is the repository for an intro to crypto using PyCrypto. It is aimed
at introducing basic cryptography topics to programmers who are 
unfamiliar with cryptography. It uses the 
[PyCrypto](https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/)
library.

The tutorial is in the doc/ folder, where there is a LaTeX source file and a
Makefile to build the PDF and (eventually the markdown file).

It includes a library of sample code to illustrate use of the PyCrypto
library as well as a tutorial. The sample code is purposefully simple to
illustrate clearly how to use the software.

Included source files (in src/):
    block.py:           block cipher example code
    block_crypt.py:     example code for using the block cipher examples
    block_tests.py:     tests for the block cipher code

    publickey.py:       public key cryptography example code
    publickey_crypt.py: example code using the public key example code
    publickey_tests.py: tests for the public key code

    tests.txt:          example validated test code output
