This is the repository for an intro to crypto using PyCrypto. It is aimed
at introducing basic cryptography topics to programmers who are 
unfamiliar with cryptography. It uses the 
[PyCrypto](https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/)
library.

The tutorial is in the doc/ folder, where there is a LaTeX source file and a
Makefile to build the PDF and (eventually the markdown file). I've 

It includes a library of sample code to illustrate use of the PyCrypto
library as well as a tutorial. The sample code is purposefully simple to
illustrate clearly how to use the software.

Included source files (in src/):

	secretkey.py	secret key cryptographic functions
	publickey.py	public key cryptographic functions
